## Why (insert tool here)?

- **Next.js**: I like the next.js app router because it has a very good developer experience and it's very easy to use.
- **TypeScript**: Don't even need to explain why
- **Tailwind CSS**: I like the utility-first approach and the speed of development it provides
- **shadcn/ui**: Copy-pasting components is so fire (also is Radix UI)
- **Lucia**: The DevEX is amazing and it's very easy to use
- **Vercel**: Next.js and Vercel are like bread and butter, but it's a bit slow with the free tier.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: It has a very generous free tier, and I'm choosing NoSQL because Postgres hates me.
- **Prisma**: Even though there are solid competitors like Drizzle, Prisma is easy to use, understand, and fast enough for my use case.
